description: Test hermesd's cross-session bot communication against a live daemon, in two modes — synthetic (double runtime, drive the MCP bus directly as the bots, free and deterministic) and real (pty runtime spawning billed Codex sessions, observing genuine bot behavior). Use when changing send_message/complete_task, the bus guardrails (reply caps, fan-out, hop limits, terminal kinds, deadlines/expiry), delivery, the system prompt's bus sections, or the artifacts flow — or when someone asks to demo, smoke-test, or observe bot-to-bot traffic on a dev daemon.

# Live bus / cross-session communication test

Runs a real `hermesd` on a throwaway home and exercises bot-to-bot traffic
end to end. Two modes, cheapest first:

- **Synthetic** (`runtime = "double"`): no Codex sessions; you act as the
  bots by calling the MCP bus with their bearer tokens. Deterministic, free,
  and the only mode where you can force every refusal on demand. Use for
  verifying daemon *rules*.
- **Real** (`runtime = "pty"`): the daemon spawns actual `Codex` sessions —
  **billed against the user's account**. Use only with explicit user consent,
  and only to observe *behavior*: do real bots obey the prompt contracts,
  brief delegations well, use artifacts, stay silent after a `done`.

## Shared setup

```bash
cargo build -p hermesd
umask 077
BUS_HOME=$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/gravity-bus.XXXXXX")
BUS_HOME=$(cd "$BUS_HOME" && pwd -P)
cat > "$BUS_HOME/hermesd.toml" <<EOF
home = "$BUS_HOME"
bind = ["127.0.0.1"]
port = 49666                 # verify this test port is free first
negotiate_port = false
runtime = "double"           # or "pty" for real mode
supervision_interval_ms = 1000

[scheduler]
tick_interval_ms = 2000      # fast expiry sweeps; default is 30s
EOF
./target/debug/hermesd --config "$BUS_HOME/hermesd.toml" > "$BUS_HOME/hermesd.log" 2>&1 &
BUS_DAEMON_PID=$!
```

Wait for the published `$BUS_HOME/hermesd.port`, verify it is 49666, and
check `curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:49666/health`. Confirm the recorded PID
is still running; stop on startup failure. Never reuse the installed daemon
or stop another process to free this port.

For **real mode** add `claude_bin = "$(command -v Codex)"` (absolute path — the
daemon's PATH may not include `~/.local/bin`) and set `runtime = "pty"`.

Create a project and bots with the bundled driver (Node 22+, no deps):

```bash
node .Codex/skills/bus-live-test/scripts/bus.mjs setup "$BUS_HOME" 49666 \
  "lead:You coordinate work." "worker:You do small jobs."
# prints {"project":..., "bots":{"lead":"<id>","worker":"<id>"}}
```

Credentials on disk: client token at `$BUS_HOME/secrets/client.token`, per-bot MCP
tokens at `$BUS_HOME/secrets/bot-<id>.token`.

## Synthetic mode: act as the bots

Set `LEAD` and `WORKER` to the IDs printed by setup. Call bus tools with
tokens loaded from disk; do not paste token values into tool calls, terminal
arguments, logs, issues, or chat. Review responses before sharing them:

```bash
mcp() { # mcp <bot-id> <tool> <json-args>; token is read only inside Node
  node .Codex/skills/bus-live-test/scripts/bus.mjs mcp "$BUS_HOME" 49666 "$@"
}
mcp $LEAD send_message '{"to":"worker","body":"do X","kind":"task"}'
mcp $WORKER complete_task '{"task_id":"...","result":"done","artifacts":["/path"]}'
```

Guardrail checklist — force each refusal and read its hint text:

1. **Reply cap**: task, then 7 replies alternating direction → 7th refused
   with `reply limit reached … complete_task`; `complete_task` still succeeds
   past the cap.
2. **Terminal kinds**: reply after the task is done → `no open task`; reply
   with `ref` pointing at a done message id → `is a task result`; kinds
   `chat`/`done`/unknown → each refused with its hint.
3. **Fan-out**: 4th open delegation from one origin → refused; allowed again
   after one `complete_task`.
4. **Depth**: chain tasks A→B→C→D→E (needs 6 bots); the send past
   `MAX_TASK_HOPS` is refused and the target's inbox stays empty.
5. **Expiry**: backdate a deadline and watch the sweep flip it and notify
   both ends exactly once:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 "$BUS_HOME/bus.sqlite" "UPDATE task SET deadline_at='2020-01-01T00:00:00Z' WHERE id='<id>';"
   # within ~2 ticks: state='expired', WARN "task exceeded its deadline" in the log,
   # one system note per live end (assignee: stop work; requester: re-delegate)
   ```

The constants live in `crates/bus/src/types/entities.rs`
(`MAX_TASK_REPLIES`, `MAX_TASK_FANOUT`, `MAX_TASK_HOPS`,
`DEFAULT_TASK_DEADLINE_HOURS`).

## Real mode: observe billed sessions

Get explicit user consent first — every bot turn is a real Codex
session on the user's account. Keep runs small: each bot burns one turn on
its creation intro before you send anything, and a 4-bot
research-synthesize-review pipeline costs roughly 8–10 turns total.

Wait for boot (`active_bots` in `/health`, `turn complete` per bot in the
log), then speak as the user:

```bash
node .Codex/skills/bus-live-test/scripts/bus.mjs chat "$BUS_HOME" 49666 <lead-bot-id> \
  "Delegate this to worker: ... When you get the result, read the artifact and tell me ..."
```

Good scenario shapes (each verified to exercise the guardrails):
- **Minimal**: delegate one artifact-producing job; instruct lead to *thank*
  the worker afterwards — the reply channel is closed after `done`, so a
  compliant lead uses a `note` and the worker stays silent.
- **Pipeline**: split a research question between two bots, synthesize their
  artifacts, and have a third bot review the synthesis ("you must not approve
  your own work") — exercises fan-out pacing, artifacts, author ≠ reviewer.

### Observation channels

- **Bus ledger** — the ground truth for chatter:
  ```bash
  sqlite3 "$BUS_HOME/bus.sqlite" "SELECT num,sender_name,kind,substr(replace(body,char(10),' '),1,100) FROM message ORDER BY num;"
  sqlite3 "$BUS_HOME/bus.sqlite" "SELECT substr(id,1,8),state,hop_count,reply_count,deadline_at IS NOT NULL FROM task;"
  ```
- **Daemon log** — bot state transitions, delivery, expiry warns.
- **Session transcripts** — tool-by-tool behavior including refusals the bot
  hit (`is_error` tool results). Workspaces under `/tmp` land in
  `~/.Codex/projects/-private-tmp-…-workspace/*.jsonl` (note the
  `-private-` prefix: macOS `/tmp` is `/private/tmp`). Extract tool calls and
  errors from the newest `.jsonl`; a bot's answer *to the user* is its last
  assistant `text` block there.

## Pitfalls learned the hard way

- **Bot replies to the user never hit the bus.** They go to the terminal, so
  don't wait on `sender_kind='bot'` message rows to detect that intros
  finished — watch `turn complete` in the daemon log instead.
- **Delivery lags ~1s** (`delivery.poll_interval_ms`): a `check_inbox`
  immediately after a send misses the message. Sleep ≥2s or poll.
- The **`done` from `complete_task`** goes into the origin conversation and
  is delivered to the requester — it will not appear in the assignee's inbox.
- **Expiry notes name only live bots**; a task whose ends were archived
  expires silently. `deadline_at IS NULL` never expires (legacy escape
  hatch).
- In synthetic mode nothing consumes inboxes, so `check_inbox` as a bot is
  also your read channel — remember every fresh bot has one `system` intro
  note to filter out.
- Real mode writes residue outside the throwaway home: transcript dirs in
  `~/.Codex/projects/` and trust entries in `~/.Codex.json` for the
  workspaces. Tell the user; do not remove it without approval.

## Cleanup

Stop only the daemon started in this live shell:

```bash
kill "$BUS_DAEMON_PID"
wait "$BUS_DAEMON_PID"
```

If the shell/session was lost, verify process ownership again before signalling.
Never use broad process-name matching. Retain the run directory and logs for
review; ask before deleting its exact path. In real mode, identify any remaining
child sessions narrowly, and obtain approval before removing their exact
transcript directories or trust entries from the user's real home.
