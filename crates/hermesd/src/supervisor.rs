//! Per-bot runtime supervision: state machine, terminal buffers, crash
//! restart with backoff, and channel delivery through each session's inbox
//! socket.
//!
//! Bots are always-on. Nothing starts them by hand: the daemon reconciles
//! every live bot into a running session at boot and on every supervision
//! tick, so the only way a bot is not running is that it just crashed and is
//! waiting out its backoff.
//!
//! Terminal input goes straight to the PTY (grant-gated at the control
//! plane); bus deliveries go through the inbox socket and never touch the
//! terminal, so they cannot interleave with the user's typing.
