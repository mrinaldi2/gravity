//! Archival deletion of a bot.
//!
//! The previous implementation deleted a handful of rows and left the rest
//! behind. That was survivable while only a human ever pressed Delete; it is
//! not now that bots delete each other. Four things it got wrong, all fixed
//! here:
//!
//! 1. It never removed the `bot` row, so a "deleted" bot stayed listed.
//! 2. It never revoked the bot's token, leaving `/mcp` and `/hook` open to it
//!    forever.
//! 3. It dropped open tasks silently, stranding every bot that had delegated
//!    work — they waited on a `complete_task` that could never arrive.
//! 4. It left the DM conversation and messages dangling.
//!
//! The workspace is deliberately *kept*. Deleting a bot should never destroy
//! work it produced; retention reclaims the directory later.
