//! Peer daemons: bots on two of the owner's machines working as one team.
//!
//! A bot that runs on a peer stands in here as a linked bot. Sending to it is
//! sending to any bot; the delivery worker forwards the message over the peer
//! link instead of writing it to a local session, and the peer stores it as if
//! the sender were one of its own. See `docs/peer-bots.md`.
