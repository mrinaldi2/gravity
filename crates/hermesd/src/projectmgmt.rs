//! Project lifecycle: creation, renaming, and archival deletion.
//!
//! A project owns a directory on disk and every bot inside it, so the two
//! mutations here are careful about different things. A rename must not touch
//! the filesystem — `dir_name` is frozen exactly so a running bot's
//! `workspace_path` stays valid — and a delete must go through
//! [`botmgmt::archive_bot`] for each bot rather than dropping rows, or it would
//! leave live runtimes holding valid credentials for a project that is gone.
