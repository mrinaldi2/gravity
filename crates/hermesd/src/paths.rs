//! On-disk provisioning of projects and bots per the architecture plan §4.4.
//! Versioned files are the source of truth for user-editable configuration;
//! SQLite owns runtime and delivery state.
//!
//! Two files carry a bot's prompt, and the split matters:
//!
//! - `system.md` is **daemon-owned**. It holds the name, description and
//!   instructions, is regenerated from the database on every identity change,
//!   and is injected with `--append-system-prompt` at spawn.
//! - `workspace/CLAUDE.md` is **bot-owned**. It is written once at creation and
//!   never rewritten, because the bot maintains it as living context. It
//!   imports `workspace/FACTS.md`, seeded the same way, which is where the bot
//!   parks facts that must outlive a compaction.
//!
//! Before the split, instructions lived in `CLAUDE.md`: editing them either did
//! nothing (the daemon only wrote the file at creation) or would have clobbered
//! the bot's own memory. Keeping the two apart is what makes instructions
//! editable at all.
