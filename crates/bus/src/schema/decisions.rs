//! Migration 12: the decision registry.
//!
//! A bot that needs the owner's ruling has had nowhere to put it. It asks in a
//! terminal the daemon cannot see, or writes "AWAITING PAWEŁ" into its memory
//! file and hopes a lead relays it — and a relayed ruling is a peer's word, not
//! authority. These tables make the ask durable and make the answer something
//! the daemon itself can deliver.
//!
//! Two things the shape here is working around:
//!
//! * `message.kind` is a CHECK constraint, and SQLite cannot alter one in
//!   place. Migration 5 already declined to rebuild `message` because six
//!   tables hold foreign keys into it. So a ruling travels as an ordinary
//!   `note` carrying the new nullable `message.decision_id`, the way
//!   `ref_message_id` already carries correlation.
//! * `source_message_id` and `source_task_id` point at rows retention deletes.
//!   They are deliberately plain columns with no `REFERENCES`: a decision
//!   outlives the exchange that prompted it, and the alternative is either a
//!   prune that fails or a registry that gets pruned away.
//!
//! `normalised_title` exists so the "you already have this open" check is an
//! indexed lookup rather than a scan over every open decision.
